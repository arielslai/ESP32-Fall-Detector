# üõ°Ô∏è Fall Detection System with ESP32 and MPU6050

This project implements a wearable fall detection system using an ESP32 microcontroller and an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope module. It detects potential falls and sends SMS alerts using a WiFi connection if the event is not canceled within a few seconds.

## üìå Features

- üìâ Detects spikes in acceleration and stillness to determine falls
- üí° Blinks LED during a cancellation window (5 seconds)
- üîò Allows cancellation via physical button
- üì≤ Sends SMS alerts using CallMeBot API over WiFi
- üîß Customizable thresholds and timing parameters

## üîß Hardware Required

- ESP32 microcontroller
- MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor
- Push button
- LED
- Resistors (as needed)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Micro USB cable for ESP32

## üìà How It Works

1. **Impact Detection**: The device monitors for a spike in acceleration using a threshold (`ACC_THRESHOLD`).
2. **Stillness Check**: After the spike, the system checks for stillness for a short delay (`STILLNESS_DELAY`).
3. **User Cancellation**: If still, it triggers a cancel window (5 seconds) during which the LED blinks and the user can press a button to cancel.
4. **Alert Sending**: If no cancellation occurs, it sends an SMS alert using an HTTP POST request to the CallMeBot API.

## üì≤ Setting Up CallMeBot

1. Save the phone number with CallMeBot's number.
2. Start a WhatsApp chat with the bot and send:
   `I allow callmebot to send me messages`
3. You‚Äôll receive an API key in response.
4. Update the following placeholders in your code:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "INSERT_WIFI_SSID";
   const char* password = "INSERT_WIFI_PASSWORD";
   const char* apiKey = "INSERT_API_KEY";
   const char* phoneNumber = "INSERT_PHONE_NUMBER";


   ## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

   - Clone this repo or copy the code to your Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your MPU6050 to the ESP32 via I2C:  
     - `SDA` to `GPIO 21`  
     - `SCL` to `GPIO 22` (default I2C pins)
   - Connect an LED to `GPIO 23` and a button to `GPIO 18` with a pull-up resistor.
   - Install the following libraries in the Arduino IDE:
     - `Adafruit MPU6050`
     - `Adafruit Sensor`
     - `WiFi`
     - `HTTPClient`
   - Upload the code to your ESP32.
   - Open the Serial Monitor at `115200` baud to observe real-time logs and sensor data.
